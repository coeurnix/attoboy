# Attoboy

Attoboy is a comprehensive, 'batteries-included' C++ library designed for building very compact, standalone Windows command-line executables. By eliminating dependencies on the STL, CRT, and libc, Attoboy generates efficient 32-bit binaries typically ranging from 5 to 100 kB that function on Windows 7 and later. The library is engineered to be an easy-to-use, self-contained solution for utility programming, providing a complete feature set without introducing binary bloat.

**WARNING**: *Attoboy is currently in very early development. Check back later for a more mature and stable version.*
