# Attoboy

Attoboy is a comprehensive, 'batteries-included' C++ library designed for building minimal, standalone Windows command-line executables. By eliminating dependencies on the STL, CRT, and libc, Attoboy generates compact 32-bit binaries typically ranging from 5 to 100 kB that function on all Windows versions released in the 21st century. The library is engineered to be a self-contained solution for utility programming, providing a complete feature set without introducing binary bloat.

**WARNING**: *Attoboy is currently in extremely early development. Check back later for a more mature and stable version.*
